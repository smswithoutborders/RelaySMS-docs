### Step 5. Save access to platforms​

One of the key features of RelaySMS is to be able to save access to online platforms while you have an active internet, then use the App to make requests to these platforms without an active internet connection. Once you login and click on Save Accounts, you will have a list of platforms we currently support. You can save your credentials for as many platforms as you can foresee further need in an offline situation.

**Note: You need to have the platform you want to save installed on your phone before you can save it on the RelaySMS platform.**

### Step 6. Configure your App and begin utilizing​

Once you've linked your apps to your RelaySMS account, you'll need to choose your preferred gateway client from the list of available gateway clients. One important setting to configure is selecting the Gateway number for communication. Opting for a Gateway number from the same service provider as yours or within your country is cheaper.

### Step 7. Gateway Clients
